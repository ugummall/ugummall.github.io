title: "Sudoku Puzzle"
---

Re-blogged from backups of 2006 for obvious reason - not to loose it again.

Once there was a competition held at Oracle IDC. It's about solving Sudoku puzzle. Whoever solves it first will be the winner. I learned about that game at that time only.

Solved myself some (Easy) puzzles which took more time than expected.
Hmmm, how should I win then? At least first top 3 positions ? I think there is no way that I can do it. 

Then a very nice idea (Should I call it like this ;)) came into this Einstein's brain. Why dont I bluff them by writing a program? Here is it what I wrote then.

But Ooopch... No use of it. They held the competition in cafetaria. Not online. I didnt participate at all just to claim If I had participated, I would have stood first position.

What's the complexity of this algo? Check out yourself. It wont be that much complexity as it seems programmatically. I mean, as the game (problem) itself cuts some paths so fast and lead to solution space because of implicit heauristics. (Also as it's for just 8 by 8 grid).
