title: "My Mothers Muktinath Trip"
---

My Mother went to Muktinath - a Pilgrimage Trip. It's located in Nepal. Trip includes Pashupathinath Temple and other tourism places in Nepal. She took lot of snaps on her new iPhone. I set those snaps as home screen and lock screens as they are damn good for those home screens. Below are the few snaps:

Below historical structures no longer exists after [recent Nepal earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_2015_Nepal_earthquake). These pictures were taken by my mom in her phone just a week days before the earthquake.
