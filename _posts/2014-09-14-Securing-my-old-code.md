title: "Securing my old code"
---

I felt I am fortunate enough to find my very old code. I lost that computer but I put up that code in HTML format in a very old blog. I am able to hack that today and got my code back. 

I wrote several games (not new/innovative but recoded in my passionate language C). I missed few of them. Here is the list. 

* [Igataxx](https://github.com/ugummall/oldgames/tree/master/Igataxx).

When I installed RedHat Linux (some version like 1.6 or so) I found <!--more--> a game there called Gataxx.
I rewrite that game in C language using Gimp Took Kit (gtk+) on that linux box. 

* [Freecell](https://github.com/ugummall/oldgames/tree/master/Freecell).

This is the standard Freecell game that you find in Windows. Written in Turbo C IDE. I bet, you can not differentiate if it's my game or the standard game that comes with Windows OS. Of course, it always offers the same problem again and again.

* [Minesweeper](https://github.com/ugummall/oldgames/tree/master/Mine-Sweeper).

Same. Written in Turbo C IDE in DOS Operating System. Replicated the standard minsweeper game that comes with Windows Operating System. Of course the same problem is offered again and again. 
While writing this I faced a strange problem (to me it was strange) of how to blast all sorrounding cells when you click on some lucky cell. While writing code for that part I ended up an active (or passive I dont remember now what it is called) recursive. That is function abc() calls pqr() and inside pqr() you call abc().... 

Not sure if any of the above code works as it is in todays systems... If it works, please send me screenshot :)

* vbcn messenger.

This is something like yahoo messenger that works in LAN. Users have to login into their machines using their users. User means the UNIX user. Then they can find other users in the same LAN and can chat the way you chat in Yahoo Messenger. Written using BSD Sockets and ncurses library. I wrote this when I was doing Networks lab (Socket Programming was a lab course at that time). Unfortunately I couldnt find the source code for this...

* Other games like "Spritor" etc..

I may loose whatever I have now. So I better put up in github. Here is the [github repo for old games](https://github.com/ugummall/oldgames)
